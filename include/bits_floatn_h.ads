  -- Defined to 1 if the current compiler invocation provides a
  --   floating-point type with the IEEE 754 binary128 format, and this
  --   glibc includes corresponding *f128 interfaces for it.  The required
  --   libgcc support was added some time after the basic compiler
  --   support, for x86_64 and x86.   

  -- Defined to 1 if __HAVE_FLOAT128 is 1 and the type is ABI-distinct
  --   from the default float, double and long double types in this glibc.   

  -- Defined to 1 if the current compiler invocation provides a
  --   floating-point type with the right format for _Float64x, and this
  --   glibc includes corresponding *f64x interfaces for it.   

  -- Defined to 1 if __HAVE_FLOAT64X is 1 and _Float64x has the format
  --   of long double.  Otherwise, if __HAVE_FLOAT64X is 1, _Float64x has
  --   the format of _Float128, which must be different from that of long
  --   double.   

  -- Defined to concatenate the literal suffix to be used with _Float128
  --   types, if __HAVE_FLOAT128 is 1.  

  -- The literal suffix f128 exists only since GCC 7.0.   
  -- Defined to a complex binary128 type if __HAVE_FLOAT128 is 1.   
  -- Add a typedef for older GCC compilers which don't natively support
  --   _Complex _Float128.   

   subtype uu_cfloat128 is Extensions.CFloat_128;  -- /usr/include/bits/floatn.h:74

  -- The remaining of this file provides support for older compilers.   
  -- The type _Float128 exists only since GCC 7.0.   
   subtype u_Float128 is Extensions.Float_128;  -- /usr/include/bits/floatn.h:86

  -- __builtin_huge_valf128 doesn't exist before GCC 7.0.   
  -- Older GCC has only a subset of built-in functions for _Float128 on
  --   x86, and __builtin_infq is not usable in static initializers.
  --   Converting a narrower sNaN to _Float128 produces a quiet NaN, so
  --   attempts to use _Float128 sNaNs will not work properly with older
  --   compilers.   

  -- In math/math.h, __MATH_TG will expand signbit to __builtin_signbit*,
  --   e.g.: __builtin_signbitf128, before GCC 6.  However, there has never
  --   been a __builtin_signbitf128 in GCC and the type-generic builtin is
  --   only available since GCC 6.
